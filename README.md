# DSA Drone Delivery System

A **Java-based Drone Delivery System** project built to demonstrate **Data Structures and Algorithms** concepts through a real-world simulation.  
This project models drone delivery routes, weather conditions, charging stations, and no-fly zones — all managed efficiently using advanced algorithmic logic.

---

## 🧠 Overview

The **DSA Drone Delivery System** simulates how delivery drones can optimize their routes and resources while considering real-world constraints like:
- Weather fluctuations
- No-fly zones
- Charging stations
- Delivery points and warehouses

The project was developed as part of coursework at **Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham**, showcasing how DSA principles power practical systems.

## ✨ Key Features

✅ **Route Optimization** – Uses graph algorithms to calculate efficient paths  
✅ **Segment Tree Service** – Handles range queries and updates efficiently  
✅ **Weather Handling** – Simulates weather conditions and their effect on drone movement  
✅ **No-Fly Zone Detection** – Prevents path conflicts dynamically  
✅ **Modular Java Architecture** – Clean separation using `models`, `services`, and `utils` packages
